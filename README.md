# One-Step Assembler for Virtual Microcontroller
This One-Step Assembler is designed for a virtual microcontroller supporting 7 instructions: MOVF, MOVWF, MOVLW, ADDLW, ADDWF, SUBWF, SUBLW.

## Usage
Prepare Instruction File: Create a text file containing the assembly instructions for your program. Each instruction should be on a separate line.

Prepare Output File: Create an empty text file where the machine code will be saved.

Run Assembler: Execute the assembler program and provide the paths to the instruction file and the output file.

View Output: Open the output file to access the machine code generated by the assembler.

## Supported Instructions
MOVF, MOVWF, MOVLW, ADDLW, ADDWF, SUBWF, SUBLW
